## Motivation

In a fast evolving tech world, it is vital to keep up the pace. The creation of this boilerplate project comes both from
the necessity of learning how to properly assemble, configure and troubleshoot a TypeScript project from scratch, including
all the needed dependencies and specificities, as well as, have a ready-to-go solution for new projects to come.

This project also intends to be a comprehensive guide to anyone wanting to follow the same path and assemble his own
project from scratch. If you are planning to do so, please take a look at the
[project documentation](https://andreros.github.io/typescript-boilerplate/).
